# Chip8 Interpreter

It's a chip8 interpreter written in C++, what else can you say. Currently finishing it.
Just run `make` to build it. Currently no good mechanism for loading programs.

- [X] Core refactor
- [ ] Quality of Life (loading commands, quasi-assembler)
- [X] Graphical Interface
- [X] Implement all commands

Bugs to fix:
- [ ] Something is causing either input or output to stutter
